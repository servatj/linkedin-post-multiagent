## What Is an AI Model Influencer on Fanvue?

An **AI model influencer** on Fanvue is a digitally crafted persona—photorealistic in appearance—created and managed using artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional human influencers, these avatars are entirely virtual, with their content, appearance, and interactions all generated or curated by AI-driven tools. Fanvue is one of the leading creator platforms to openly welcome and support these AI personas.
