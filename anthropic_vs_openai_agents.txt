Anthropic's Agents SDK adopts a unified agent architecture, where agents natively integrate both tool and subagent functionalities. This design enables agents to invoke tools or orchestrate subagent workflows within a seamless, iterative control loop.

Notably, Anthropic does not formalize handoff or ownership transfer constructs—agents retain contextual control throughout, relying on internal state management rather than explicit delegation or authority transfer.

In contrast, OpenAI's Agents SDK clearly delineates three paradigms:

1. Agent-as-tool: where an agent programmatically leverages another agent as a callable utility

2. Explicit handoffs: delegating a task and contextual authority to another agent

3. Ownership transfer: shifting durable state or task ownership

These mechanisms are formally supported with distinct API patterns and robust documentation, empowering developers to architect complex, multi-agent systems with precise control over inter-agent workflows and responsibilities.

In summary, Anthropic emphasizes simplicity and unified control, while OpenAI provides explicit, modular constructs for delegation and dynamic ownership—offering more granular governance of agent collaboration and lifecycle events.
